I spoke to Christina about the time limit and wanted to complete the assignment, but also leave a note to
where I finished prior. In the time frame I was only able to just start the third examples, more so I was only able to
 set up the WebTables button. So I did the remainder of problem 3 outside the time frame. The other things that
 I did outside the time frame, was moving the driver to the Protractor page as well as adding
 errorLoginMessageBox, logOutButton, waitForElement10sec, and comments. I originally had thread.sleep for the
 parts as a quick solution.

 Instructions on how to run:
 You will need to go to PagesProtractor, and find setChromeDriverProperty (this should be located on line 111)
 In here you're going to want to edit the location of where you have Chrome driver saved, more so take this part:
 "/Users/theresasvoboda/Documents/selenium/chromedriver" and replace it to the path where you have it saved
 Once that is done you should be able to run TestCases, you can usually do this a variety of ways but depending on your
 choice of IDE, there could be a green play button, or a run in the top navigation bar.
